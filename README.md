#Flow
Flow is an aesthetically and aurally pleasing model of inelastic collisions between circles in a 2D space with inertia. 

You can (and should) visit this project at any time on any device at http://projectflow.azurewebsites.net

##Running Flow 
Flow is a web app written in TypeScript, which is a language that compiles down to JavaScript. This means that Flow can be run locally on any (modern) browser with absolutely no need for extra plugins or runtimes. Just open the index.html file in your browser (right click and then click Open With for your browser) and you should be good to go!
##Project Files
Our source code files are written in TypeScript with a .ts file extension. You will also see .js and .js.map versions of each TypeScript file, these are just the products of compiling the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
##Features
###Mouse Slingshot
Using the mouse, you can click on a circle to pick it up and then move the mouse, while still holding down the mouse button. When you let go, the circle will "slingshot" towards the original location of the circle.
